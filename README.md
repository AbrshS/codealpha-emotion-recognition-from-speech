# Emotion Recognition from Speech

This repository implements an emotion recognition system using speech data and deep learning. It provides a Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and inference, along with a pre-trained model for immediate use.

## Project Structure

- **emotion-recognition-from-speech.ipynb**  
  Main notebook for data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- **models/**  
  Contains the best trained model for emotion recognition.

- **Data/**  
  Directory for datasets and related resources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `emotion-recognition-from-speech.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, or use the pre-trained model for inference.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or Keras
- librosa
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

(Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if available.)
